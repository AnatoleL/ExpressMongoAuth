# Express Mongo Auth

This is a far-from-perfect showcase project demonstrating what I can do with an express/mongodb backend written with TypeScript.

I give full credit to the [Bulletproof express server](https://github.com/santiq/bulletproof-nodejs) for techniques and inspiration.

## How to use

You will need a NodeJs package manager, like npm, then:

```
npm i; npm start:prod
```

you can also run the testsuite

```
npm test
```
